## Deploying 3-Tier Architecture with Terraform
This README provides a brief guide on deploying a 3-tier architecture using Terraform. 

The 3-tier architecture consists of three layers: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer. 

We will use Terraform to provision resources on a cloud provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to set up this architecture.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

An account on your chosen cloud provider.

Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from Terraform's official website.

Basic knowledge of Terraform.
## Project Structure
The project structure typically consists of the following directories:

presentation/: This directory contains resources related to the presentation layer, such as load balancers, virtual networks, and security groups.

application/: Resources for the application layer, including virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions, are defined here.

data/: Resources for the data layer, such as databases, data storage, and caching services.
## Deployment Steps
## Configure Authentication:

Ensure you have configured your cloud provider's credentials on your local machine. 

This usually involves setting environment variables or using a configuration file.
## Initialize Terraform:

In each subdirectory (presentation, application, and data), run terraform init to initialize Terraform and download the required providers and modules.
```bash
terrafrom init
```
## Define Infrastructure:

Create .tf files in each subdirectory to define your infrastructure. 

Use Terraform's declarative language to specify the resources you need.

## Plan the Deployment:

Run terraform plan in each subdirectory to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
```bash
terraform plan
```
## Apply Changes:

If the plan looks good, execute terraform apply in each subdirectory to create the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform apply
```
## Testing:

Test your 3-tier architecture to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

You may need to configure DNS or networking settings to route traffic appropriately.
## Monitoring and Scaling:

Set up monitoring and alerting for your architecture to ensure it runs smoothly. Consider auto-scaling options based on traffic demands.
## Destroying Resources (Optional):

When you're done with your project, run terraform destroy in each subdirectory to remove all provisioned resources. 
Be cautious with this step, as it will delete everything.
## Conclusion
You have successfully deployed a 3-tier architecture using Terraform. 
This architecture separates presentation, application, and data layers, providing scalability and maintainability for your applications.
Remember to follow best practices for security, backups, and ongoing maintenance.
